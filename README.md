Adguard Whitelist

Different categories of Adgaurd Whitelist
I have built this based on my family's surfing behaviour. It is quite nice to block everything, but it also causes problems for various areas. That's why I've created a whitelist for certain areas.
If anyone has any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to suggest them to me.
